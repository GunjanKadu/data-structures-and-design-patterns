### Creational- Based on the concept of creating an object.
| Type        | Description
|-------------|-----------------------------------------
| **Class**
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Factory Method	| This makes an instance of several derived classes based on interfaced data or events.
| **Object**
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Abstract Factory  | Creates an instance of several families of classes without concrete classes.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Builder | Separates object construction from its representation, always creates the same of object.
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Prototype | A fully initialized instance used for copying or cloning.
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Singleton | A class with only a single instance with global access point

### Structural  -   Based on the idea of building blocks of objects.
| Type        | Description
|-------------|-----------------------------------------
| **Class**
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Adapter | Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together incompatible interfaces.
| **Object**
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Adapter | Match interfaces of different classes therefore classes can work together incompatible interfaces.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Bridge  | Separates an object's interface from its implementation so the two can independently.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Composite | A structure of simple and composite objects which makes the total object than just the sum of its parts.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Decorator | Dynamically add alternate processing to objects.
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Facade  | A single class that hides the complexity of an entire subsystem.
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Flyweight | A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing of information that contained elsewhere.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Proxy | A place holder object representing the true object.

### Behavioral  -  Based on the way objects play and work together.
| Type        | Description
|--------------|-----------------------------------------
| **Class**
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Interpreter | A way to include language elements in an application to match the grammar of the intended language.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Template Method | Creates the shell of an algorithm in a method, then defer the exact steps to a subclass.
| **Object**
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Chain of Responsibility  | A way of passing a request between a chain of objects to find the object that can handle the request.
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Command | Encapsulate a command request as an object to enable, logging and/or queuing of requests, and provides error - handling for unhandled requests.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Iterator  | Sequentially access the elements of a collection without knowing the inner workings of the collection.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Mediator  | Defines simplified communication between classes to prevent a group of classes from referring explicitly to each other.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Memento | Capture an object's internal state to be able to restore it later.
| <ul><li>[x]</li></ul> Observer  | A way of notifying change to a number of classes to ensure consistency between the classes.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> State | Alter an object's behavior when its state changes.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Strategy  | Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class separating the selection from the implementation.
| <ul><li>[ ]</li></ul> Visitor | Adds a new operation to a class without changing the class.
